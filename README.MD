**[2023.10.4]** We have achieved a successful scale-up of our model to **G/14**, attaining an impressive **83.0%** zero-shot top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset.
For the detailed training configuration, please refer to the [t5x branch](https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/CLIPA/tree/t5x/clipa_jax/configs/model_bigG). Additionally, you can access the pre-trained and fine-tuned weights for the JAX version in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nu5i8mLbOvYq4kovoLP85DjjV8I3N46L?usp=sharing).

**[2023.9.21]** [Our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07017) is accepted by **NeurIPS 2023**!


**[2023.6.16]**  We release [CLIPA-v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15658). Compared to the prior best publicly available CLIP model, our CLIPA-v2 can be trained significantly faster and yields stronger performance. Our best model is H/14@336x336 on DataComp-1B with an accuracy of 81.8, and its estimated training cost is <$15k! 
<br>

**[Note]** All of our [CLIPA-v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15658) models were trained on TPU using our [JAX codebase](https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/CLIPA/tree/master/clipa_jax). We followed the same pre-training process as CLIPA-v1, but with a more efficient fine-tuning strategy. In order to replicate our results, we have provided the **training configuration** (e.g. the H-14 model in this folder [here](https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/CLIPA/tree/master/clipa_jax/configs/model_h)), along with the **pre-trained weights, configuration, and logs**, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ArW1-JL7DL43ifg47cIJ4CBeMFIpPkrR?usp=sharing).

Our CLIPA-v2â€™s GPU hour is estimated using an 8-A100 80GB GPU machine on Google Cloud. 
The corresponding training cost is estimated based on 80GB A100â€™s cloud pricing.


## Introduction
CLIP, the first foundation model that connects images and text, has enabled many recent breakthroughs in computer vision. 
However, its associated training cost is prohibitively high, imposing a significant barrier to its widespread exploration. 
In this paper, we present a surprising finding that there exists an _inverse_ scaling law for CLIP training, 
whereby the larger the image/text encoders used, the shorter the sequence length of image/text tokens that can be applied in training. 
Moreover, we showcase that the strategy for reducing image/text token length plays a crucial role in determining the quality of this scaling law.

As a result of this finding, we are able to successfully train CLIP even by using academic resources. 
For example, on an A100 eight-GPU server, our CLIP models achieve zero-shot top-1 ImageNet accuracies of **63.2%** in about **2 days**, 
**67.8%** in about **3 days**, and **69.3%** in about **4 days**. 
By reducing the computation barrier associated with CLIP, we hope to inspire more research in this field, particularly from academics.

## TPU Usage
Our experiments are conducted on both GPUs and TPUs. Both the JAX and PyTorch implementations enable TPU training.
